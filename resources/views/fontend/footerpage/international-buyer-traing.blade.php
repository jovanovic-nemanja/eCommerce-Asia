							<p>Buyer behavior information for the international marketplace is a complicated and challenging topic. The wide range of information that is needed to develop markets outside of an organization’s home country covers everything from the basic economic data (to ensure that there are markets) to very complicated buyer behavior profiles needed to develop the specific strategies surrounding the market mix of product, price, promotion and distribution. Included are "hard" data needs specific to evaluating the county as a potential international market. That is, those areas considered as indicators of economic development and market size. This is critical whenever assessing developing nations as a potential marketplace, especially for consumer goods.</p>

<p>In most studies, a search is first conducted of any secondary information sources that may be available on a particular country or culture. Secondary data, however, are not without problems.</p>

<p>In the acquiring of secondary data, the data may be for more than one market area, covering several different countries with very diverse cultural and behavior factors. This may be true even when dealing with a regional trade area such as the European Union. Each country will have a unique set of challenges that must be addressed by the marketer.</p>

<p>In developing nations, secondary data may have serious flaws, or be totally nonexistent. Even if there are data in existence, the difficulty may be in acquiring access to it, or it may be very outdated, inaccurate, or in a form that is not usable to the researcher.</p>

<p>In most highly industrialized countries, the access to secondary information to partially aid in the obtaining of information surrounding buyer behavior issues may be more readily available through governmental agencies, commercial sources, periodical sources (usually available through a country’s various types of libraries) and internet sites. Also, many local research organizations may be able to provide data as a commercial enterprise (i.e., for a fee).</p>

<p>Business and trade associations provide information to their memberships; many of these may be in localized trade areas where there are heavy concentrations of that particular industry. There are other business associations that do not limit interests to a particular industry, but have information on a wide range of areas. In the United States, for example, there is the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, which has more than 100 local Chambers that maintain foreign trade bureaus to serve members engaged in foreign commerce. A very helpful source to aid in finding these associations is the Trade Directories of the World (a loose-leaf volume by Croner Publications, San Diego, California), which may be available in the reference section of a major library. This publication lists more than 3000 trade, industrial and professional directories in 1000 categories across 175 countries (Cateora and Graham).</p>

<p>Many companies are in business of selling services, thus must keep up with international developments, issues and opportunities. The information these organizations gather may be available to their client companies. Typical organizations here are banks, transportation companies (international airlines, steamship lines), advertising agencies (BBDO, Young & Rubicam, Saatchi & Saatchi, J. Walter Thompson), accounting firms (Price Waterhouse), and international shippers (UPS, Federal Express, DHL).
The search for information on buyer behavior issues in the international marketplace usually surrounds these areas:</p>

<p>1. Who makes what purchase decisions?</p>

<p>2. Who influences these decisions?</p>

<p>3. How are goods purchased? by whom? How often? Where?</p>

<p>4. How are prices negotiated? Are the prices negotiated?</p>

<p>5. How do consumers/buyers find out about products?</p>

<p>6. Where are products available?</p>

<p>7. Media habits or profiles of buyer market.</p>

<p>8. Do buyers prefer local products or do they like foreign products? For all products or only products in certain categories? Or, does it matter in your particular market? (Perception of foreign products by the market).</p>

<p>9. What factors specific to the product may be affected/influenced by buyer issues? That is, such details as the colors available, the product design, etc.).</p>
