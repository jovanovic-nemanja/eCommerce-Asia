He discovered that Bangladesh is lagging behind despite the rich resources and manpower only due to the unavailability of tools and capacities. Therefore, out of his Love for his country, he started BuyerSeller with the hope that it will allow all the SMEs of Bangladesh and other South Asian countries to expose their rich industries both domestically and internationally. With the help of technology and innovation, it is possible to create a positive and long-lasting impression to the world. </p>
